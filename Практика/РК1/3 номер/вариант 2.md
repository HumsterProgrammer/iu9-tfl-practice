### \(\mathcal{L} = \{ a^n b^m c^{\min(n, m)} \}\)

Let's apply the pumping lemma:

$$
w = w_0 z_1 y z_2 w_1
$$
$$
|z_1 y z_2| \leq p
$$
$$
|z_1 z_2| \neq 0
$$
$$
w_0 z_1^k y z_2^k w_1 \in \mathcal{L} \quad \forall k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}
$$

Let's look at \(a^{2p} b^{2p} c^{2p}\) which obviously belongs to the language \(\mathcal{L}\). Let's look at the block division \(\rho_1 = a^{2p}; \rho_2 = b^{2p}; \rho_3 = c^{2p}\). To use the Pumping Lemma, you need to pump each block and their jumpers.

If we pump each block separately, the balance will be disturbed. For example, if we pump only the first block negatively, then at some point we will have an error in the third block: contradictions with minimality. Similarly with the second block. If we pump the third block negatively, then we will have an error in that in the first and second blocks \(m\) and \(n\) will be greater than the minimum of \(m\) and \(n\).

If we pump the jumper between the first and second blocks, we will also get a contradiction with the minimality. If we pump up the jumper between the second and third blocks, then we can pump so much there that there will be fewer elements in the first block and we will also get a contradiction with the minimality.
